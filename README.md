# Login Authentication Form
# Overview
This project demonstrates a simple login authentication form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes form validation to ensure that users input the correct data format and provides feedback to users.

# Tools and Technologies Used
1. HTML: Used to structure the login form.
2. CSS: Used for styling the form and making it visually appealing.
3. JavaScript: Used to handle form validation and user authentication.

# Features
1. User Input Validation: Ensures that the user inputs meet the required format (e.g., valid email format, password length).
2. Error Messaging: Provides feedback to users when inputs are invalid.
3. Responsive Design: The form is designed to be responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
4. Password Visibility Toggle: Allows users to show/hide their password input.
5. Mock Authentication: Simulates user authentication with predefined user credentials.

# How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open index.html in your web browser.
3. Enter the email and password (use user@example.com and password123 for the mock authentication).
4. Submit the form to see the validation and authentication in action.

# Future Improvements
1. Connect to a backend server for real user authentication.
2. Implement more robust error handling and feedback.
3. Enhance UI with more advanced CSS and JavaScript animations.
